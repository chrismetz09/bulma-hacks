                    Many Public, private and hybrid cloud operators have arrived at the on-ramp to “interstate cloud
                    native”. Some have even blown through the metering lights and are accelerating, ready to leave those
                    still picking up speed in the dust. Cloud native offers heaps of advantages: deployment velocity,
                    horizontal scalability, resiliency, faster devops, optimized resource utilization and really cool
                    project names with neat looking icons
                    <br></br>
                    Carving up application monoliths into smaller chunks of code called microservices; packaging up
                    microservices into containers; housing said containers in PODs running on hosts (virtual or
                    physical);
                    using Kubernetes to orchestrate and schedule POD placements commanded by applications across
                    standard
                    Kubernetes (K8S) APIs - is THE way – the cloud native way.
